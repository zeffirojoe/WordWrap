To compile and run my program copy and paste the following while in my directory:


g++ -o zeffiro_program1 program1.cpp && ./zeffiro_program1 FILENAMEHERE && vim zeffiro_answer

or just use this one for the TaleOfTwoCities text file:

g++ -o zeffiro_program1 program1.cpp && ./zeffiro_program1 TaleOfTwoCities && vim zeffiro_answer



The output of this program is put into a new file named answer which will be made in the same directory upon running the program.
